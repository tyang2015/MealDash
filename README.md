# `MealDash`

## Hungry for an overview?

MealDash is a full stack application that allows users to create their own restaurants, menu items, and book orders from other restaurants to be delivered and viewed in an innovative and user-friendly way. It is designed to mimic the overall core functionality and UI of its more daring parent website, popularly known as DoorDash. 

## Architectural Layout
MealDash is built on a React frontend with a Python flask backend, using SQLITE for development and PostgreSQL for production.

## Frontend Overview
MealDash is very front-end heavy with React that takes care of data filtering, display such as phone fields with various JS functions, and data manipulation from the backend to create new data structures, utilizing cookies and local storage, for best UI experience. 

### Frontend Technologies Used
#### React
Includes API libraries such as reach/combobox, react-google-maps/api, use-places-autocomplete, geocoding, and directions (last 4 are self-contained libraries within Google API).

### Backend Technologies Used
#### Python Flask
Uses wtforms validations and SQLAlchemy ORM for fetching, reading, inserting, and deleting data from a PostgreSQL RDB
Used with wtforms validations and Flask-SQLAlchemy to validate forms and analyze client requests. 

## Concluding Remarks
MealDash is meant to be a beautifully crafted app that aims model the parent website, known for upholding its customer-oriented culture. DoorDash is a personal favorite of mine and has many complex functionalities bundled in a modular, mobile-oriented app whose features are constantly being improved. I chose this project not only from personal preference, but also because I see it as a challenging, fun, and long-term journey for future expansion and a self-reflective project that documents my growth as a becoming software engineer.
